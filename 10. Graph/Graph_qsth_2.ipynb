The problem can be modeled by means of the Diophantine equation of the form mx + ny = d which is solvable if and only if gcd(m, n) divides d. Also, the solution x,y for which equation is satisfied can be given using the Extended Euclid algorithm for GCD. \n",
    "For example, if we have a jug J1 of 5 liters (n = 5) and another jug J2 of 3 liters (m = 3) and we have to measure 1 liter of water using them. The associated equation will be 5n + 3m = 1. First of all this problem can be solved since gcd(3,5) = 1 which divides 1 (See this for detailed explanation). Using the Extended Euclid algorithm, we get values of n and m for which the equation is satisfied which are n = 2 and m = -3. These values of n, m also have some meaning like here n = 2 and m = -3 means that we have to fill J1 twice and empty J2 thrice. \n",
