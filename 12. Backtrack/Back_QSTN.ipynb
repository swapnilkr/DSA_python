    "Backtracking is an algorithmic paradigm that tries different solutions until finds a solution that “works”. Problems which are typically solved using backtracking technique have the following property in common. These problems can only be solved by trying every possible configuration and each configuration is tried only once. A Naive solution for these problems is to try all configurations and output a configuration that follows given problem constraints. Backtracking works in an incremental way and is an optimization over the Naive solution where all possible configurations are generated and tried."

Because in some situations the first found word from the left side can leave a remaining portion that is not further separable. So, in that case, we should come back and leave the currently found word and keep on searching for the next word. And this process is recursive because to find out whether the right portion is separable or not, we need the same logic. So we will use recursion and backtracking to solve this problem. To keep track of the found words we will use a stack. Whenever the right portion of the string does not make valid words, we pop the top string from the stack and continue finding."
