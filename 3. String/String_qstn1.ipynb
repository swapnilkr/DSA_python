The number of possible characters is higher than 10 (256 in general) and pattern length can be large. So the numeric values cannot be practically stored as an integer. Therefore, the numeric value is calculated using modular arithmetic to make sure that the hash values can be stored in an integer variable (can fit in memory words). To do rehashing, we need to take off the most significant digit and add the new least significant digit for in hash value. Rehashing is done using the following formula. \n",
    "\n",
    "hash( txt[s+1 .. s+m] ) = ( d ( hash( txt[s .. s+m-1]) – txt[s]*h ) + txt[s + m] ) mod q \n",
    "hash( txt[s .. s+m-1] ) : Hash value at shift s. \n",
    "hash( txt[s+1 .. s+m] ) : Hash value at next shift (or shift s+1) \n",
    "d: Number of characters in the alphabet \n",
    "q: A prime number \n",
    "h: d^(m-1)"
